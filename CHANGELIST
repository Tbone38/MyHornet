	v115:
		-DONE:
			Added member Find Filters,
			Added 'Add Notes' button on Member Details Page,
			Added PendingDeletes table (no code uses it atm, because you can't delete from the app).
			Added Visit History Page,
			Added Programme Group to Find Filter,
			Save Filter settings permanently.
			Added Medical details to member notes page.
			Cancel booking return to the booking screen after OKAY button pressed
			Remove tasks icons from last visitor.
			Fix crash when click on home button from Empty activity and member ship hold (bad parent activity in manifest)
			Added emergency contact access details to member notes page.
			Fixed the Date table, it now dynamically fills in days 1 month in advance as needed.
			Moved Free ID's into a seperate table using the TableIDs as reference.
			Added triggers on tables for insertion/update.
			Added Booking Day swipe (SEE KNOWN BUGS)
			Added parentname (YMCA)
			Added Roll Call feature, automatically generates a roll off of the members by there membership.
			Roll Call feature uses filter as default membership for generating rolls.
		-TODO:
			Log Sync Errors, and upload them somewhere?
			YMCA REQUESTS:
				-enrolled in,
			Handle permissions/Roles for different staff, to limit what certain staff can see.
			Setup the automated database script.
			Get Users (when they download the app) email address, so we can contact them (leads etc).
		-KNOWN BUGS/TO FIX:
			-fix Get Card for new cards.
			-manual checkin might hard-crash if the door is null (why wasn't there any doors?)
			-the booking swipe view pager doesn't invaildate cached fragments when the date is set. 
				This means that one of the (5) fragments may show the wrong date.
			-The database sync runs out of memory on large databases (e.g. YMCA db).
