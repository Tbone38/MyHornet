	(V116):
		-TODO:
			On first run, we prompt for an easy setup/install.
				This easy setup gets there email address & gymname/organisational name.
				A central database (sms.treshna.com) generates a username and password, and emails said password the email-address.
				the username is used for the web-address (username.SERVERLOCATION.gymmaster.co.nz).
					the username needs to be unique.
				We query the central database (using the username and password) for the database name (g_USERNAME) & location (SERVERLOCATION.gymmaster.co.nz).
				Will all need to be handled by JSON and only run very occasionally (only once?).
				
				& Someones going to magically tie this in with the WhatNext database, in order to keep track of client-leads/etc.
			
			Handle permissions/Roles for different staff, to limit what certain staff can see.
			upload the log.file after each sync to a server.
				-the log.file needs a unique identifier so we know which device has the issues.
				-we need to check that the file isn't empty before we upload it. (only upload files with actual warnings/errors in them).

	-KNOWN BUGS/TO FIX:
		-fix Get Card for new cards.
		-manual checkin might hard-crash if the door is null (why wasn't there any doors?)
		-the booking swipe view pager doesn't invaildate cached fragments when the date is set. 
			This means that one of the (5) fragments may show the wrong date.
		-The database sync runs out of memory on large databases (e.g. YMCA db).
		-Sometimes app needs to restart for the roll menu item to show up.
		-Sometimes the BookingOverview list shows bookings, but when click the BookingResource list can't find the bookings.
			Overview list only shows on tablets.
			This may be caused by the wrong date/resource being passed?
