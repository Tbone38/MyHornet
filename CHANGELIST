	v115:
		-DONE:
			Added member Find Filters,
			Added 'Add Notes' button on Member Details Page,
			Added PendingDeletes table (no code uses it atm, because you can't delete from the app).
			Added Visit History Page,
			Added Programme Group to Find Filter,
			Save Filter settings permanently.
			Added Medical details to member notes page.
			Cancel booking return to the booking screen after OKAY button pressed
			Remove tasks icons from last visitor.
			Fix crash when click on home button from Empty activity and member ship hold (bad parent activity in manifest)
			Added emergency contact access details to member notes page.
			Fixed the Date table, it now dynamically fills in days 1 month in advance as needed.
			Moved Free ID's into a seperate table using the TableIDs as reference.
			Added triggers on tables for insertion/update.
			Added Booking Day swipe sorta (SEE KNOWN BUGS)
		-TODO:
			Log Sync Errors, and upload them somewhere?
			YMCA REQUESTS:
				-enrolled in,
				-Roll Call.
				-parent name?
		-KNOWN BUGS/TO FIX:
			-fix Get Card for new cards.
			-manual checkin might hard-crash if the door is null (why wasn't there any doors?)
			-Booking Swipe page has bad date handling (when a page that isn't #2 changes the date, 
				the code assumes it was #2 and adjusts the dates for the other pages accordingly.)
