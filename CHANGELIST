	v115:
		-DONE:
			Added member Find Filters,
			Added 'Add Notes' button on Member Details Page,

			Added Visit History Page,
			Added Programme Group to Find Filter,
			Save Filter settings permanently.
			Added Medical details to view.
			Cancel booking return to the booking screen after OKAY button pressed
