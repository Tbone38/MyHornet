        -KNOWN BUGS/TO FIX:
                -fix Get Card for new cards.
                -manual checkin might hard-crash if the door is null (why wasn't there any doors?)
                -the booking swipe view pager doesn't invaildate cached fragments when the date is set.
                        This means that one of the (5) fragments may show the wrong date.
                -The database sync runs out of memory on large databases (e.g. YMCA db).
                -Sometimes app needs to restart for the roll menu item to show up.
                -Dates need to be handled better. Currently they're breaking on Dru's phone because the default format (Date().toString()) returns differently.
                        Fix is to call SimpleDateFormat.format(Date()) instead of trying to parse the Date().toString().

	V116:
		-DONE:
                	On first run, we prompt for an easy setup/install.
                        	This easy setup gets there email address, gymname/organisational name, a username, & a location.
                                        the username needs to be unique.
					the email address needs to be unique.	
                                the username is used for the web-address (username.SERVERLOCATION.gymmaster.co.nz).
				the username is used for the database name (g_<USERNAME>)
                                passed to a cental database on sms.treshna.com, which generates a password, and emails said email-address the password.
					the username, password, db_name, and server are returned by the API
				It's all passed through a JSON (flask) server (api.gymmaster.co.nz).
		-TODO:
                        Handle permissions/Roles for different staff, to limit what certain staff can see.
                        upload the log.file after each sync to a server.
                                -the log.file needs a unique identifier so we know which device has the issues.
                                -we need to check that the file isn't empty before we upload it. (only upload files with actual warnings/errors in them).
                                -this can probably go into our central db?
                        Remove membership.
